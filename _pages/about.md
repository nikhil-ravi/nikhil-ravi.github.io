I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University, working in the SINE lab under Professor Anna Scaglione. My research is focused on complex networked dynamic systems, in particular on developing Byzantine fault-tolerant decentralized optimization algorithms and privacy-preserving mechanisms for the smart grid. Most recently, I have been developing Differentially Private techniques for enabling data analysis to detect and investigate cyberattacks against energy delivery systems while also preserving aspects of key confidentiality elements within the underlying raw data (about distribution circuits and the consumers).
